# foundryvtt-generic-spell-macros

This is a collection of custom macros to add visual flair without the reliance on automation.

These are provided as working examples, but make no promises of long term compatibility or functionality.

Feel free to use them with or without modification however you want.

## Required Modules
These macros require the following modules

* [Sequencer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sequencer)
* [JB2A - Jules&Ben's Animated Assets](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/JB2A_DnD5e) (Full paid version [here](https://www.patreon.com/JB2A))

## Suggested Modules
